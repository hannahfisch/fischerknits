                            Every knitting project starts with casting on. To begin casting on, make a pretzel 
                            shape with the yarn. The needle will go under the middle right piece of yarn. Pull the 
                            yarn tight.  This is the first stitch! Continue casting on until the desired amount of
                            stitches are made on the knitting needle.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Knit and Purl Stitch</h3>
                            <p>

                            The classic stitch people think of when they invision knitting, is the knit stitch.  It looks 
                            like a braid and is the easiest stitch.  The purl stitch is the reverse of the knit stitch and it appears
                            as ripples in the work.
                            Many projects include a rib, which pairs the knit stitch with the purl stitch.  Rib's are 
                            used for the bottom of a hat or mittens or cuffs of a sweater and many other projects. This picture 
                            is of a rib of a sweater. It is following a pattern of knit one purl one for a certain length.

                            <h3>Binding off</h3>
                            <p>

                            Binding off is essential for all projectst that end in closed edges. This basic way of binding 
                            off entails knitting two stitches (either knit stitch or purl stitch) and then taking the first
                            stitch and dropping it from the needle.  When the binding off is complete it leaves
                            the top of the project looking like a braid.  Some exceptions to this way of binding off are hats and bags.
                            A hat and a bag both end in a closed area.  The top of a hat or the bottom of a bag is where it is bound.
                            For these projects the binding off is more similar to sewing. Threadig the excess yarn through the open stitches
                            and then weaving the yarn through past stitches ending with tying a knot between the excess yarn and the project.
                            This photo shows the binding off of a project that has been knitted in a knit purl pattern, similar to a rib.
